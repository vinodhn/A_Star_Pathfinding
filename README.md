# A* Pathfinding
Simple A* Pathfinding and Visualization in Python

# To Run Program:
Download AStar.py and main.py
-AStar.py is the pathfinding file. Once it finds the path, it will return a list of tuples (coordinates) that the GUI will show

-main.py is the main file of this program. You run this file, set a start node, end node, wall nodes, then press start. The program
will find a path and then print it out in the console (in this commit only)
