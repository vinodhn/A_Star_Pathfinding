# A_Star_Pathfinding
Simple A* Pathfinding in Python

Give the program a 10x10 grid with walls, set a start and end point and hit run.
The program will then find the path from start to end and print it to console
Once the path is found, it will create a Tkinter window with a grid of squares to help visualize the path.

# To Run Program:
Download AStar.py and window.py
-AStar.py is the pathfinding file. Once it finds the path, it will print it out as a list of tuples in console/
-window.py is called once the path is found and will create a visual of the path.
